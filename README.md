# Princess Maker 4

**Work in progress!** This project aims to recreate source code for ***Princess Maker 4*** by decompiling its code by hand. **The repository does not contain assets or assembly code.** To build the ROM, you must own an existing
copy of the game to extract assets from.

> [!NOTE]
> The project targets the Japanese version, and other versions might be supported later.

This game was released with its source code in the game's files, this project **do not** publish it. Symbol names might be used (exactly like using a symbol map file) but the code itself will be recreated as mentioned above.
